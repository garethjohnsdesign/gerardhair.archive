- title: Colour
  text: At Gerard we only use professional, toxic free colour, devoid of Ammonia,
    PPDs, PTDs, Parabans, and Resorcinol. We are able to deliver beautiful blondes,
    full grey coverage, and seamless balayage without the crap. Our colour gives you
    a more even, long lasting result, which is gentler on your hair, your scalp, and
    the environment.
- title: Treatments
  text: In the salon and as part of our retail offering, we use and recommend products
    and gentle styling methods that care for and nourish your hair. This ensures your
    hair is in the best possible condition between appointments. However, hair colour,
    and in particular lightening hair colour can affect the health of your hair. An
    in salon treatment is a nourishing way to restore the quality and health of your
    hair.
