We are all very sad and heartbroken to have to announce that Monday 23 March 2020 will be our last working day in the salon until it is deemed safe to open our doors again.

With the government guidelines on social distancing and being two metres away from one another, it is impossible to carry on in the salon for everyone's safety and health. Once all of this has blown over and we are out the other side, we will be back, stronger than ever and ready to work our hair magic for you.

Take this time to spend time with your loved ones. 

Stay home, stay safe and look after each other.

Team Gerard
